# **Blueprint – Desktop Modules Platform (PLASMODE)**

## **0\. Definition & Purpose**

A universal, open-source platform (hereafter "the Platform") for creating, deploying, and managing interactive desktop **Modules**—dynamic UI elements that can be developed by the community and deeply integrated with the desktop environment. Inspired by Rainmeter, but built with a modern, secure, and performant architecture.

**Core Philosophy:** PLASMODE is not a skinning system. It is an application host. Each Module is a sandboxed mini-app with potential for full system access (if authorized by the user), managed by the core Platform Engine.

**Target Audience:** Developers, power-users, and enthusiasts seeking maximum control and customizability, with cross-platform reach (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**For a detailed technical breakdown, see the [Platform Technical Architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=link_to_be_defined) document. For module development, refer to the [Module SDK & API Reference](https://www.google.com/search?q=link_to_be_defined).**

## **1\. Naming Convention**

* **Module:** The core term for any user- or developer-created desktop element (UI \+ Logic).  
* **Module Pack:** A bundle of Modules, possibly themed or functionally grouped.  
* **Platform Engine:** The core application that orchestrates Module rendering, permissions, and API access.  
* **Runtime Worker:** A shared background process (e.g., for Node.js or Python) that executes the logic for all modules using that specific runtime, ensuring resource efficiency.

## **2\. Core Features & Architecture**

### **a)** High-Level Stack Overview

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **UI Engine** | Tauri (Rust \+ HTML/JS/TS) | Fast, lightweight, cross-platform GUI for Modules and the Platform Shell. |
| **OS Integration Backend** | .NET (Windows), Rust/C++ (macOS, Linux) | Deep OS hooks, true desktop overlays, native notifications, and system APIs. |
| **Module Logic Runtimes** | Node.js, Python (via Shared Runtime Workers) | Executes module logic in isolated, resource-efficient background processes. |
| **Inter-Process Comms (IPC)** | JSON-RPC over stdio | Lightweight, high-performance communication between the Rust Engine and Runtime Workers. |
| **Inter-Module Comms** | Asynchronous Event Bus | Allows modules to communicate with each other, enabling complex automations. |

### **b)** Architectural Principles

* **Performance First:** The **Shared Runtime Worker** model is central. Instead of launching a process per module, the Engine manages one worker process per required technology (e.g., one for all Node.js modules). This drastically reduces memory and CPU overhead.  
* **Security by Design:** Modules operate in a sandboxed environment. All potentially dangerous operations require explicit, granular permissions declared in a module.json manifest and approved by the user.  
* **True Desktop Integration:** The Platform utilizes native OS backends for seamless, performant desktop overlays (supporting transparency, click-through, and docking), avoiding the limitations of simple "always-on-top" windows.

### **c)** Module System

* Modules are self-contained directories with a module.json manifest, UI assets (HTML/JS/CSS), and logic scripts (Node.js or Python).  
* **Live Reload/Hot-Swap:** Add, remove, or modify Modules without restarting the Platform Engine.  
* **Dependency Management:** The Platform will manage dependencies and versions to prevent conflicts.

**For the complete module.json schema and API definitions, see the [Module SDK & API Reference](https://www.google.com/search?q=link_to_be_defined).**

### **d)** Permissions & Security Model

* **Granular by Default:** Modules declare required permissions in their manifest (e.g., network.allowedHosts, os.readFile).  
* **User-Centric:** The user must approve all permissions at install time and can review or revoke them at any time from the Platform Engine's security dashboard.  
* **Code Signing (Future):** A reputation system based on signed modules will be encouraged for community trust.

**For a detailed breakdown of the security architecture, see the [Platform Technical Architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=link_to_be_defined).**

### **e)** Module Marketplace & Updates

* An in-app or web-based "Marketplace" for discovering, installing, updating, and rating Modules/Module Packs.  
* Secure, with automated checks for malicious code patterns and permission abuse.

## **3\. Development, Documentation, and SDK**

* **Documentation:** All Platform docs (user, developer, architectural) will be in English, publicly versioned, and maintained.  
* **SDK:** A comprehensive SDK will provide CLI tools, module templates, a live testing environment, and a manifest validator.  
* **Community:** All development will be open-source, managed via GitHub, welcoming community contributions.

## **4\. Roadmap (High-Level, Iterative)**

1. **MVP Core Engine:** Tauri UI shell, **Windows-first .NET backend**, and the **Node.js Shared Runtime Worker** architecture. Establish the core IPC and overlay functionality.  
2. **Module API & SDK (v1):** Implement the core plasmode API, create the SDK tooling, and publish detailed documentation with examples.  
3. **Security & Permissions MVP:** Implement the manifest-based granular permission system and user-facing approval UI.  
4. **Marketplace Beta:** Launch a basic in-app browser for discovering and installing modules.  
5. **Cross-Platform Expansion:** Develop the Rust/C++ backend for macOS/Linux and introduce the **Python Runtime Worker**.  
6. **Advanced Features:** Inter-module event bus, AI integrations, enhanced automation triggers.

## **5\. Challenges & Mitigations**

* **IPC Complexity:** Mitigated by choosing a simple, robust standard (JSON-RPC over stdio) and documenting it thoroughly in the architecture guide.  
* **Security Risks:** Mitigated by a strict, granular, user-approved permission model from day one. Sandboxing is not an afterthought.  
* **Performance Overhead:** Mitigated by the Shared Runtime Worker architecture, lazy-loading of modules, and resource monitoring tools for the user.  
* **Onboarding Curve:** Mitigated by providing a high-quality SDK, clear documentation, and a rich library of example modules.
