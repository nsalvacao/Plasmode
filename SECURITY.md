# SECURITY – PLASMODE Universal Desktop Modules Platform

## 1. Security Principles
- **Security by Design:** All platform and module features are designed to be secure by default.
- **Granular Permissions:** Modules declare all required permissions in `module.json`. Users approve or revoke at any time.
- **Sandboxing:** Module logic runs in isolated workers. Direct OS access is forbidden; all privileged actions are brokered via the Engine.
- **Zero Trust for Modules:** Never assume a module is safe – every privileged call is validated.
- **User Privacy:** No data is collected, stored, or sent externally without explicit user consent.
- **AI Security:** All local and cloud AI calls are sandboxed, mediated, and cannot access raw credentials.

## 2. Best Practices for All Contributors
- **Never commit or expose API keys, tokens, passwords, or secrets** in code, configuration, documentation, or examples.
- **Do not hardcode absolute file paths**; always use relative paths or dynamic discovery.
- **Validate all external input and sanitize outputs** to prevent injection or XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Use the secure Platform Vault** for all secret/key management; modules must never read or write raw secrets.
- **Minimize permissions**: Only request what is absolutely necessary in `module.json`.
- **Be explicit in all permission requests**: List specific hosts, files, APIs, and never use wildcards unless justified.
- **Respect user data and privacy**: Never collect, transmit, or store user data without clear, opt-in consent and a privacy notice.
- **Never bypass or work around** the platform's security broker, sandboxing, or permission system.
- **Do not use deprecated or unsafe libraries**; always update dependencies and report security issues.
- **Log security-relevant events** (e.g., denied permission, failed auth) to assist with incident response.

## 3. AI-Specific Security Guidelines
- **AI modules must disclose all endpoints, models, and key requirements** in both documentation and `module.json`.
- **All cloud calls must go via the Engine's secure broker**; modules never access raw API keys.
- **Data privacy:** Never process, log, or transmit sensitive user data to AI endpoints without clear consent.
- **Models and endpoints should be up-to-date and not known to be vulnerable.**
- **Local AI integration must not expose system resources** beyond what is permissioned.
- **Always handle and sanitize AI output** before use in the UI or for automation.

---

## 4. Reporting Vulnerabilities
- **If you discover a vulnerability, report it promptly and privately** to the maintainers at [nexo-modeling@outlook.com].
- **Do not publicly disclose security issues** until they have been triaged and a fix is released.
- **Security issues are given the highest priority** and a coordinated disclosure process is in place.

---

## 5. Security Review & Incident Response
- All code and modules are subject to automated and manual security reviews.
- The Marketplace runs automated checks for permission abuse, credential leakage, and malicious patterns.
- Any module or code found in violation may be disabled, removed, and reported.
- Security incidents are logged and may be summarized in the project CHANGELOG.
